# Vehicle CO2 Emissions Analysis

This repository documents my journey into AI and machine learning, focusing on analyzing factors that influence vehicle CO2 emissions.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explore the relationships between various vehicle characteristics (engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption) and CO2 emissions using linear regression models.

## Learning Goals
- Apply linear regression techniques to real-world data
- Practice data visualization and interpretation
- Compare models to identify the strongest predictors
- Document and share findings in a reproducible manner

## Data Sources
This analysis uses vehicle emissions data from 2014 and 2025.
